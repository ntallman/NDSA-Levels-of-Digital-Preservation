# NDSA Levels of Digital Preservation
|                                     | **Level 1 (Protect your data)**                              | **Level 2 (Know your data)**                                 | **Level 3 (Monitor your data)**                              | **Level 4 (Repair your data)**                               |
| ----------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Storage and Geographic Location** | * Two complete copies that are not collocated<br />* For data on heterogeneous media (optical discs, hard drives, etc.) get the content off the medium and into your storage system | * At least three complete copies <br />* At least one copy in a different geographic location <br />* Document your storage system(s) and storage media and what you need to use them | * At least one copy in a geographic location with a different disaster threat <br />* Obsolescence monitoring process for your storage system(s) and media | * At least three copies in geographic locations with different disaster threats <br />* Have a comprehensive plan in place that will keep files and metadata on currently accessible media or systems |
| **File Fixity and Data Integrity**  | * Check file fixity on ingest if it has been provided with the content * Create fixity info if it wasnâ€™t provided with the content | * Check fixity on all ingests <br />* Use write-blockers when working with original media-Virus-check high risk content | * Check fixity of content at fixed intervals<br /> * Maintain logs of fixity info; supply audit on demand <br />* Ability to detect corrupt data <br />* Virus-check all content | * Check fixity of all content in response to specific events or activities <br />* Ability to replace/repair corrupted data <br />* Ensure no one person has write access to all copies |
| **Information Security**            | * Identify who has read, write, move and delete authorization to individual files <br />* Restrict who has those authorizations to individual files | * Document access restrictions for content                   | * Maintain logs of who performed what actions on files, including deletions and preservation actions | * Perform audit of logs                                      |
| **Metadata**                        | * Inventory of content and its storage location <br />* Ensure backup and non-collocation of inventory | * Store administrative metadata <br />* Store transformative metadata and log events | * Store standard technical and descriptive metadata          | * Store standard preservation metadata                       |
| **File Formats**                    | * When you can give input into the creation of digital files encourage use of a limited set of known open formats and codecs | * Inventory of file formats in use                           | * Monitor file format obsolescence issues                    | * Perform format migrations, emulation and similar activities as needed |
